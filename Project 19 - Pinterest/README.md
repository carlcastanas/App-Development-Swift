==========

Pinterest is a simple app showing waterfall implementation rather than a real copy of that famous one. It is the demo app of Ray Wenderlich's blog: [UICollectionView Custom Layout Tutorial: Pinterest](https://www.raywenderlich.com/107439/uicollectionview-custom-layout-tutorial-pinterest). You could find how to implement a basic waterfall view by subclassing UICollectionView and dynamically adjust the height of each item using custom layout attributes.
